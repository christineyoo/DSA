7. Compute the sequence
What does the following algorithm do? What is its runtime complexity? Explain your answer

function compute(num) {
    let result = [];
    for (let i = 1; i <= num; i++) {

        if (i === 1) {
            result.push(0);
        }
        else if (i === 2) {
            result.push(1);
        }
        else {
            result.push(result[i - 2] + result[i - 3]);
        }
    }
    return result;
}

ANSWER: The following algorithm creates an array of numbers that follow the fibonacci sequence. I think its runtime complexity is linear time because there is a direct proportion between the run time and size of the input. If num=5, there would be 5 iterations through the for loop. If num=10, there would be 10 iterations through the loop.
