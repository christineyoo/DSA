8. An efficient search
In this example, we return to the problem of searching using a more sophisticated approach than in naive search, above. Assume that the input array is always sorted. What is the Big O of the following algorithm? Explain your answer

function efficientSearch(array, item) {
    let minIndex = 0;
    let maxIndex = array.length - 1;
    let currentIndex;
    let currentElement;

    while (minIndex <= maxIndex) {
        currentIndex = Math.floor((minIndex + maxIndex) / 2);
        currentElement = array[currentIndex];

        if (currentElement < item) {
            minIndex = currentIndex + 1;
        }
        else if (currentElement > item) {
            maxIndex = currentIndex - 1;
        }
        else {
            return currentIndex;
        }
    }
    return -1;
}

ANSWER: Ths Big O for this algorithm is logarithmic time O(log(n)) because this algorithm cuts the problem size in half each round through. Rather than checking each element, this algorithm finds the midpoint index and runs some if checks, and resets the minimum or maximum index to a value that is approximately half of what it was before.
