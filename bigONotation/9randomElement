9. Random element
What is the Big O of the following algorithm? Explain your answer

function findRandomElement(arr) {
    return arr[Math.floor(Math.random() * arr.length)];
}

ANSWER: The Big O for this algorithm is constant time O(1) because whether there are 5 elements or 500 elements in the array, it will take the same amount of time to find a random element.
