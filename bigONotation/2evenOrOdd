2. Even or odd
What is the Big O of the following algorithm? Explain your answer

function isEven(value) {
    if (value % 2 === 0) {
        return true;
    }
    else {
        return false;
    }
}

ANSWER: I think the Big O for this one is constant time O(1) because whether the number is small like 2 or large like 2002, the response time is the same because it's just a simple calculation (mod 2).
