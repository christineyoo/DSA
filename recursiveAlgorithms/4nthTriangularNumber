4. nth Triangular Number
Calculate the nth triangular number. A triangular number counts the objects that can form an equilateral triangle. The nth triangular number is the number of dots composing a triangle with n dots on a side, and is equal to the sum of the n natural numbers from 1 to n. This is the Triangular Number Sequence: 1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, 28, 36, 45.

 Input: The nth number in the Triangular Number Sequence (ex: 5)

 Output: 15

 Input to each recursive call: one natural number less than n.

 Output of each recursive call: n + triNum(n-1)
 Example:
 5 +
 5 + 4 +
 5 + 4 + 3 + 
 5 + 4 + 3 + 2 +
 1 +

 The time complexity for this algorithm is polynomial time because 1 input => 1 time unit. 2 inputs => 3 time units. 3 inputs => 6 time units. It's not growing as much as exponential, but it's not exactly doubling either.
