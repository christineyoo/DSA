1. Counting Sheep
Write a recursive function that counts how many sheep jump over the fence. Your program should take a number as input. That number should be the number of sheep you have. The function should display the number along with the message "Another sheep jumps over the fence" until no more sheep are left.

Input: 3

Output:
3: Another sheep jumps over the fence
2: Another sheep jumps over the fence
1: Another sheep jumps over the fence
All sheep jumped over the fence

Input to each recursive call: number (one less than the previous number)

Output of each recursive call: <number - 1>: Another sheep jumps over the fence

The time complexity for this one is linear because the size of the input and the running time is directly proportional. 2 inputs => 2 time units, 4 inputs => 4 time units
