5. String Splitter
Write a recursive function that splits a string based on a separator (similar to String.prototype.split). Don't use JS array's split function to solve this problem.

Input: 02/20/2020
Output: ["02", "20", "2020"]

Input to each recursive call: the remaining characters in the string after the separator has been removed.

Output of each recursive call: an array with each element being a string. Each string element is a set of adjacent characters before the separator.

stringSplitter(str, sep) {
    let array = [];
    for (let i = 0; i < str.length; i++) {
        if (str[i] === sep) {
            remove the separator;
            [].push(str.substring(0, i-1));
            stringSplitter(str.substring(i, length-1))
        }
        return [].push(str)
    }
}

The time complexity for this algorithm is linear because if the number of separators present in a string doubles, then the running time also doubles. There is a direct proportion.
