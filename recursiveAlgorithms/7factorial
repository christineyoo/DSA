7. Factorial
Write a recursive function that finds the factorial of a given number. The factorial of a number can be found by multiplying that number by each number between itself and 1. For example, the factorial of 5 is 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 120.

Input: number (5)

Output: number (120)

Input of each recursive call: the number minus 1.

Output: the input *


const factorial = function(n) {
    if (n === 0) return 1;
    return n * factorial(n-1);
}

5 * factorial(4) = 5 *
4 * factorial(3) = 4 *
3 * factorial(2) = 3 *
2 * factorial(1) = 2 *
1 * factorial(0) = 1 *
