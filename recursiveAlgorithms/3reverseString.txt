3. Reverse String
Write a function that reverses a string. Take a string as input, reverse the string, and return the new string.

Input: string ("pizza")

Output: string with reversed order of characters ("azzip")

Input to each recursive call: a single character, specifically the last character. Then the second to last character. Then the third to last character... etc.

Output of each recursive call: a concatenated string of each input of each recursive call.
Example:
"a"
"a" + "z" = "az"
"az" + "z" = "azz"
"azz" + "i" = "azzi"
"azzi" + "p" = "azzip"

The time complexity for this one is linear because 5 inputs => 5 time units. 10 inputs => 10 time units.
