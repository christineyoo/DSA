2. Power Calculator
Write a function called powerCalculator() that takes two parameters, an integer as a base, and another integer as an exponent. The function returns the value of the base raised to the power of the exponent. Use only exponents greater than or equal to 0 (positive numbers)

powerCalculator(10,2) should return 100
powerCalculator(10,-2) should return exponent should be >= 0

powerCalculator(b, e) {
    if (e < 0) {
        return "exponenent should be >= 0";
    }
    return b ** e;
}

Input: base (b) and exponent (e)

Output: number

Not seeing the recursive part?

The time complexity for this one is constant because it's just a simple calculation of taking the base and raising it to the e power. b and e can be any values and it will take the same amount of time.
